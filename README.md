# üåü Awesome Frontend Roadmap

This is a **personal collection of hand-picked frontend resources** I‚Äôve gathered (and used!) on my learning journey ‚Äî mainly focused on **React**, **Next js**, **TypeScript**, and modern web tools and best practices.

üóìÔ∏è Most of the content is relevant for **2024‚Äì2025**, and I‚Äôve organized them into categories to make it easier for anyone learning or revisiting core frontend concepts. also handy for my own reference!

This list includes:

- Tutorials and learning paths I found helpful
- Advanced articles that helped me "level up"
- Tools and libraries I use often
- Things I would personally recommend to any frontend developer

> Whether you're just starting out or already on your journey ‚Äî I hope this roadmap helps you level up üöÄ
